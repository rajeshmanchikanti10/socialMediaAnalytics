As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions. It wasn\\'t a problem if the account was closed, but my money(\"$930\") was detained saying that it would not be refunded.

However, all the packing supplies we're ordering are getting delayed so much that we're canceling the orders and making lots of inconvenient trips to Home Depot.\\n\\nI've been a customer of Amazon since the company began (buying books and most of my CD's over the years) and I've never seen customer service get this bad.

I also can\\'t return the item via the Amazon Hub Lockers within my own apartment building. When I asked why, the only answer I got was that it was Amazon policy that some items couldn\\'t be returned to certain locations... no helpful information as to what is preventing me from returning the item via a location actually convenient to me.\\n\\nI mean, I can just throw it in a box and put it in the UPS drop-box down the block... but what is the point of having Amazon locations *everywhere* if they can\\'t have useful support for customers?

I recieved the notification at almost 6pm though. So I went outside and checked the porches of my neighbors and no package was in sight. I went on amazon and it stated to wait 2 days as it might just be that they marked it too early. Is this common, for mailmen to not deliver the package until a day or 2 later? If it doesnt show up, is there a guarantee that I either get those items or get my money back? I paid a heafty amount of money for them and it would suck to lose them.

       "  'Hello everyone,\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI\\'ve seen the threads of other friends whose Amazon Japan account has been banned here, but my situation is a little different. As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions. It wasn\\'t a problem if the account was closed, but my money(\"$930\") was detained saying that it would not be refunded.

I went on amazon and it stated to wait 2 days as it might just be that they marked it too early. Is this common, for mailmen to not deliver the package until a day or 2 later?

However, Hermes the current delivery company, says on their website about my order, that it arrived in the warehouse on June 7th 12:08pm and on June 7th 12:09pm it was send back to the Amazon return warehouse.

This is a 15 minute walk ONE WAY and then they have to go back and do it again for each additional package or set of packages they can reasonably carry at one time. Of course we drive to them and get the packages so they don’t have to do this but we aren’t always home. The drivers “now pack mules” say they are no longer allowed to drive down our drive.

I recieved the notification at almost 6pm though. So I went outside and checked the porches of my neighbors and no package was in sight. I went on amazon and it stated to wait 2 days as it might just be that they marked it too early. Is this common, for mailmen to not deliver the package until a day or 2 later?

It gives Comcast Xfinity customers a public wifi SSID named “xfinitywifi” they can use anywhere it’s available, after authenticating. This offering is made possible by exposing the “xfinitywifi” channel publicly through routers that Comcast Xfinity customers lease. That channel is encrypted and capped, just like we’ve heard Amazon is planning with Sidewalk. This wifi channel is widely available, giving Comcast Xfinity customers roaming wireless broadband Internet access in a way that’s nearly seamless. It was a \"forced\" opt in and no one had a fit, people were thrilled to have roaming wifi. Suddenly, with Amazon, people are upset. Did we have privacy issues when Comcast did it in 2014?

While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country.

For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her.

Then, through my mother's e-mail, my mother's residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response.

Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response.

In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account.

I waited on my living room since 1pm (usual time USPS delivers mail in my neighborhood) and sat there for hours. Finally at 3pm the USPS arrived and delivered some mail and just left. I checked if my items had been marked as delivered but it kept saying they were still on their way. I waited for a few more hours (still waiting) and I get a notification that the items had been delivered. I check and it states they were delivered at 3pm, the same time the mailman came by. I recieved the notification at almost 6pm though. So I went outside and checked the porches of my neighbors and no package was in sight. I went on amazon and it stated to wait 2 days as it might just be that they marked it too early. Is this common, for mailmen to not deliver the package until a day or 2 later? If it doesnt show up, is there a guarantee that I either get those items or get my money back? I paid a heafty amount of money for them and it would suck to lose them.

      "I've seen the threads of other friends whose Amazon Japan account has been banned here, but my situation is a little different. As you know, we can't find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\r",

      "When I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her.

Then, through my mother's e-mail, my mother's residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother's account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\r",

In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive.

I recieved the notification at almost 6pm though. So I went outside and checked the porches of my neighbors and no package was in sight. I went on amazon and it stated to wait 2 days as it might just be that they marked it too early. Is this common, for mailmen to not deliver the package until a day or 2 later? If it doesnt show up, is there a guarantee that I either get those items or get my money back? I paid a heafty amount of money for them and it would suck to lose them.
